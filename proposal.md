# OIM3640 Term Project - Jared, Ross, Ryan

## The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you generate? What is your minimum viable product? What is a stretch goal?

Our team will be creating retirement plan software. This software will take various inputs from the user, such as age, income level, preferred retirement age, and perhaps even the type of investments the user would like to make. In the end, the software would generate a plan for the user to help them achieve their retirement goals. 

## Learning Goals: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.

This is a useful project for us as a group since we are all seniors about to head into our professional careers. The results that this program would return will be useful after college since it would give us a perspective on how close we are to retirement and how much more money/time is remaining until retirement. As far as learning goals, we will have to use most of the topics we learned throughout the semester in order to complete our project. This will serve as an opportunity for us to practice what we learned, and for the first time do it without guidelines or help. As we will be building the program from scratch, it will be a test of our foundational knowledge of python.
 
## Implementation Plan: this will probably be pretty vague initially. Perhaps at this early juncture you will have identified a library or a framework that you think will be useful for your project. If you don't have any idea how you will implement your project, provide a rough plan for how you will determine this information.

First and foremost, we need to properly research all the finance formulas and topics we will be including in our program. Luckily, two members on the team (Ross and Jared) have experience having taken many advanced finance courses at Babson, but we will still be doing our due diligence and making sure we are using all the proper formulas in our program. We will then have to build a base code to incorporate these formulas and be able to call the proper formulas based on the inputs provided by the user. The program will get increasingly complicated depending on how many inputs we choose to accept, as each input/combination of inputs will lead to the use of different formulas. We will be utilizing Flask to have our python code interact with our html website. 
 
## Project schedule: You have 4 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Sketch out a rough schedule for completing the project. Depending on your project, you may be able to do this in great specificity or you may only be able to give a broad outline. Additionally, longer projects come with increased uncertainty, and this schedule will likely need to be refined along the way.

Week 1: Research finance formulas and topics. We need to have a set plan for what the bare minimum inputs will be, and how the inputs determine which formulas to use.

Week 2: Design a function that outputs data appropriate for input with collected data and finance formulas. Collect designed functions and develop them into Python code. By week 2, we need to have the base “bare minimum” code complete. 

Week 3: In week 3 we will start to make our program more complex by allowing it to accept more inputs, which would provide results that are more specific and customized for the user. In week 3 we will also start to create a website using html (flask) based on our code. We will create a website that shows the results of the financial calculations that the user inputs as they enter and the retirement plan.

Week 4: We will further develop our website. To help users understand the results, we will make the website more user-friendly and try to create solutions that are as customized and specific to the user as possible.

## Collaboration plan: How do you plan to collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you split tasks up, complete them independently, and then integrate? Will you pair program the entire thing? Make sure to articulate your plan for successfully working together as a team. This might also include information about any software development methodologies you plan to use (e.g. agile development). Make sure to make clear why you are choosing this particular organizational structure. 

What we felt while doing this assignment 3 was that synergy was effective when our team worked together. At first, we tried to divide the project, but the progress was slow. Since we completed assignment 3 while complementing each other, we will proceed with the major parts of this project together. We believe that working together will be most effective because this prevents miscommunication and misunderstandings. While it may seem that we would be more efficient if we divided up tasks, we noticed that this usually leads to confusion so we have decided to work together.
 
## Risks: What do you view as the biggest risks to the success of this project?

The complexity of the program is dependent on how many different types of inputs we decide to accept from the user. If we get too far ahead of ourselves and try to accomplish too much, we run the risk of creating a program that is too complex to be functional. We will have to find a balance of creating the best program we can while still making it feasible and functional.
Our project and website are tools that make it easy for users to plan their finances. It helps to make financial planning easier and is the role of a calculator. We will warn the user that there is a great risk if the user plans his or her life in unconditional confidence in the resulting financial projections.
 
## Additional Course Content: What are some topics that we might cover in class that you think would be especially helpful for your project?

N/a, the content we have covered thus far should be adequate to get even the most complex version of our app completed.
